# Morse_decoding
Morse_decoding with a Goertzel filter for android.
           
           Orginal code from 
CW Decoder made by Hjalmar Skovholm Hansen OZ1JHM

This code is for an atmel 328 - Arduino 

This is a test if the same aproach can be used for
an Android device.

See all the comments from Hjalmar on his code how
this decoding is done.

For Android the Nano timer is used and it seems to work.
