# Morse_decoding
Morse_decoding with a Goertzel filter for android.
           
           Orginal code from 
CW Decoder made by Hjalmar Skovholm Hansen OZ1JHM
http://skovholm.com/cwdecoder

His code is for an atmel 328 - Arduino 

This is a test if the same aproach can be used for
an Android device.

See all the comments from Hjalmar on his code how
this decoding is done.

The Arduino C code is converted into B4A code.
For Android the Nano timer is used and it seems to work.
